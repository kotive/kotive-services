# How to configure Kotive to use your Slack account

1. Head over to https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/ in your web browser to set up a new webhook. You may be prompted to log in, and if so, don't worry! You can do this safely (: for now
2. Near the bottom of the page is a 'Post to Channel' section. This is where you'll be deciding where your webhook will post messages, or in layman's terms, who Kotive will talk to
3. You can choose from an existing channel in the drop down menu, or you can click the link below it to create a brand new channel. You can also use this window to configure Kotive to send message to individual users.
4. Once you've decided on the channel to post to, hit the big green 'Add Incoming Webhooks Integration' button
5. Nearly done! For the most part you can ignore this page, but make sure to copy the URL in red marked 'Webhook URL' in the Setup Instructions panel, and copy it into Kotive.
6. That's it! You're all set! Happy Kotiving :P
